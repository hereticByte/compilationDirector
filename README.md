# compilationDirector


For the time being this repository only serves as a residence for the XML-Schema file for the compilationDirectives that are processed by the compilationDirector.

If the day ever comes, that the compilationDirector is published as openSource, the nameSpace of the .XSD file is equal to its URL and so does not need to be changed.
